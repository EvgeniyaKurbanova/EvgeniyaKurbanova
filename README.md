- 👋 Hi, I’m @EvgeniyaKurbanova
- 👀 I’m interested in QA
- 🌱 I’m currently learning testing in all types
- 💞️ I want to collaborate with cool teams focused on a bright future without critical mistakes
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wanted to become a writer, and in the end I got 1 ruble for my writing work. Not being a tester, I earned 150 rubles on crowd testing. Further - more!
